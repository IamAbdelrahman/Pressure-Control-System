## Project Description

The Pressure Control System is designed for monitoring and controlling pressure in a cabin or closed environment. It includes a pressure sensor that detects pressure values and triggers an alarm when the pressure exceeds a certain threshold.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of pressure values.
- Alarm activation when pressure exceeds 20 bars.
- Automatic alarm deactivation after 60 seconds and if the pressure becomes below 20 bars.
- User-friendly interface.

## Prerequisites
### Hardware Requirements 
- STM32 Microcontroller
- 8 Button Switches
- 1 LED
### Software Requirements
- Proteus Simulation
- Visual Studio CodeIDE
- GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain
- Makefile

## Usage

### Hardware Connections
- Connect the 8 switch buttons to GPIO PortA pin0:7 act as the pressure sensor.
-  Connect the LED indicator to GPIO PortA pin13.
## Testing

To ensure that the Pressure Control System operates correctly, follow these test procedures:
### Test Case 1: Alarm Deactivation

**Description:** Confirm that the LED alarm indicator turns off when pressure is below the threshold.

**Test Steps:**

1. Build and flash the project to the microcontroller.
2. Apply pressure to the sensor beyond the threshold (e.g., < 20 bars). Through pressing the switch button (Set PA0, and PA0:PA3).
3. Observe the LED indicator on the microcontroller board.

**Expected Results:** The LED alarm indicator should turn off when the pressure is below the threshold and toggles when the pressure exceeds the threshold.

### Test Case 2: Alarm Activation

**Description:** Confirm that the LED alarm indicator toggles for some milliseconds when pressure exceeds the threshold.
**Test Steps:**

1. Build and flash the project to the microcontroller.
2. Apply pressure to the sensor above the threshold (e.g., > 20 bars). Through pressing the switch button (Set PA0+PA7, and PA0:PA4).
3. Observe the LED indicator on the microcontroller board.

**Expected Results:** The alarm LED should remain on for some milliseconds when triggered.
